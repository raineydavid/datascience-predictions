Predictive Analytics From IBM Watson


Predict customer interest to optimize a campaign with ML + DO
This project has a Jupyter notebook written in Python named Promote financial products to bank customers that first analyzes data from the known_behaviors.csv and unknown_behaviors.csv data sets to understand and visualize past customer behavior.

Next, the notebook trains a machine learning model to predict which customers would be likely to buy which product in the new year, and visualizes these predictions. Then the notebook defines a decision optimization model and solves it for the input data, which includes the predictions from the ML model. The DO model determines the optimal marketing campaign actions of which customers to offer which products to achieve the optimal results, given the constraints.
